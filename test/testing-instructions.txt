Instructions for how to test Secure Adder

- Download or clone serverless-add repo from https://github.com/cnh57811/serverless-add
- Open 'Secure Adder.postman_collection.json' in Postman.
- Run 'sls deploy' from serverless-add/services/adder.
- Copy the GET endpoint from the console output into the 'add' request url field in the postman collection.
- Replace {value1} and {value2} with any integers
- Login to the aws console.  Go to:
    - Cognito
    - Manage User Pools
    - user-pool-dev
    - App clients
    - Show Details
- From the AWS console, copy the 'App client id' into the 'Username' field in the postman token request under the Auth tab.
- From the AWS console, copy the 'App client secret' into the 'Password' field in the postman token request under the Auth tab.
- Click Send
- You should see an 'access_token' in the response window.  Copy that access_token.
- Paste the access_token into the Authorization value field of the add request under the Headers tab.
- Click Send
- You should receive a valid response with the sum of the 2 numbers entered for {value1} and {value2}.

Bonus: Under the params tab of the token request, check the box next to scope:users/subtract.  Retrieve a different access 
token and paste the new token into the Authorization field of the add header.  Notice the add request returns a "message: Unauthorized".
This is because by default, the access_token is configured with both scopes(users/add and users/subtract).  If the scope is specified to 
users/subtract, the token can only be used with http methods that have users/subtract as a valid OAuth scope.  Our add method has 
users/add scope set as a valid scope, thus a token encoded with only users/subtract will not be authorized.
